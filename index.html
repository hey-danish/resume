							<code style="margin-top:1%;">I successfully introduced a groundbreaking <a href="https://vimeo.com/772797009" target="_blank">eAuction As A Service</a> platform to the Indian market, marking the inception of a new company. The innovative concept attracted significant attention from investors, and the product was available to the public for one year. As the business landscape evolved, the need to adapt led to a change in the Line of Business (LOB) for the company. This transition caused a temporary pause in onboarding activities, and eventually, market shifts led to the cessation of operations by the end of 2020. Consequently, the product was taken off the public domain, concluding this exhilarating journey.<br> Skills ― AWS, Python, HTML, Django, MySQL, WSGI, Integrations (Payment, SMS, S3, Email), etc. <br>
