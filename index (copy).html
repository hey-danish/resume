It attracted the attention of various Investors, and the product was out to the public for a year. Due to the need to adapt to the evolving dynamics of the business model, it became necessary to change the Line of Business (LOB) of the establishment. This change resulted in the temporary pause of onboarding activities, and eventually, due to market shifts, the operational existence of the establishment ceased by the end of 2020. The product went off the public domain following this short exciting journey. <br>
